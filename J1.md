## Questions:
1. Fault localization is the process of **indetifying the problematic lines** in code that doesn't perform the task it is meant to perform.
2. What are the benefits of TDD:
   - Asserting the test cases first will provide an outline for the code
   - Simplifies fault localization
   - Easier to manage and modify code
3. Domain Partitions:
  - Only made up of letters, numbers, and underscore:
      - ```(Jake1,valid)```
    - Contains at least one number
      - ```(jake, invalid)```
    - Contains at least one uppercase letter
      - ```(jake1, invalid)```
    - Contains at least one lowercase letter
      - ```(JAKE1, invalid)```
  - Contains gmail
      - ```(andre@gmail.com, invalid)```
      - ```(Andre29, valid)```
